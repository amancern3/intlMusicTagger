# International Music Tagger System
## Expanding on Cyanite AI's API 

This is *Expanding Music Tagging Beyond Western Genres and Forms* by Amandeep Singh and Adam Sabra for the [1st Sound of AI Hackathon.](https://musikalkemist.github.io/thesoundofaihackathon/).

In this project, we expanded above the API of the sponsor [Cyanite.ai](https://cyanite.ai/) to allow for expanded genre and form classification. More specifically, expanding to Arab Andalusian and Hindustani genres and forms, thanks to the [Dunya](https://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/) API created by the researchers at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.
